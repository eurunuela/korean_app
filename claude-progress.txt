# Korean App - Claude Progress

## 2026-01-07: Fixed Duplicate Cards

### Issue Found
- The Korean word '차' (cha) appeared twice in vocabulary.js with different meanings:
  - Line 60 (v044): Tea (food category)
  - Line 239 (v195): Car (transport category)

### Resolution
- Disambiguated the cards by adding Korean context in parentheses:
  - `차 (음료)` = Tea (음료 means "beverage/drink")
  - `차 (교통)` = Car (교통 means "transportation")
- Added missing pronunciation field to the car entry

### Files Modified
- src/data/vocabulary.js

### Verification
- Ran duplicate check script
- Korean vocabulary: 223 cards, no remaining duplicates
- Basque vocabulary: 240 cards, no duplicates found

## 2026-01-07: Fixed Days Without New Content

### Issue Found
- 21 days in the Korean curriculum had lesson blocks without `moduleId`/`lessonId`
- These days would show no actual curriculum content to learners

### Days Fixed
- Weeks 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (Day 6 each)
- Weeks 15-24 (Day 6 each)

### Resolution
- Added appropriate `moduleId` and `lessonId` references to all lesson blocks
- Mapped lessons to relevant curriculum modules (grammar, vocab, situations, listening, etc.)

### Files Modified
- src/data/schedule.js

### Verification
- Total lessons: 94
- Lessons without moduleId: 0 (all fixed)

## 2026-01-07: GitHub Repository Setup

### Actions
- Initialized git repository
- Updated .gitignore (added node_modules, dist)
- Created initial commit with all project files
- Created public GitHub repository

### Repository
- URL: https://github.com/eurunuela/korean_app
- Connected to Vercel for automatic deployments

## 2026-01-16: Fixed Daily Lesson Navigation

### Issue Found
- When clicking "Go to Lesson" on the home page, users were shown a multi-lesson navigation view
- Multiple days could link to the same lesson, showing all lessons in the module
- Each day should have its own direct lesson view without navigation clutter

### Resolution
- Updated Home.jsx to include lessonId in the lesson link URL (`/lesson/${moduleId}/${lessonId}`)
- Modified Lesson.jsx to detect "direct lesson mode" when lessonId is in the URL
- In direct lesson mode, the lesson navigation is hidden and users see only the specific lesson content
- Module browse mode (without lessonId) still shows the full lesson navigation
- Fixed App.jsx route parameters from `:weekId/:dayId` to `:moduleId/:lessonId`

### Files Modified
- src/pages/Home.jsx
- src/pages/Lesson.jsx
- src/App.jsx

### Result
- Each day's "Go to Lesson" button now links directly to the specific lesson
- No more multi-lesson navigation view when accessing from daily schedule
- Users can still browse all lessons in a module via the sidebar navigation
