# Korean App - Claude Progress

## 2026-01-07: Fixed Duplicate Cards

### Issue Found
- The Korean word '차' (cha) appeared twice in vocabulary.js with different meanings:
  - Line 60 (v044): Tea (food category)
  - Line 239 (v195): Car (transport category)

### Resolution
- Disambiguated the cards by adding Korean context in parentheses:
  - `차 (음료)` = Tea (음료 means "beverage/drink")
  - `차 (교통)` = Car (교통 means "transportation")
- Added missing pronunciation field to the car entry

### Files Modified
- src/data/vocabulary.js

### Verification
- Ran duplicate check script
- Korean vocabulary: 223 cards, no remaining duplicates
- Basque vocabulary: 240 cards, no duplicates found

## 2026-01-07: Fixed Days Without New Content

### Issue Found
- 21 days in the Korean curriculum had lesson blocks without `moduleId`/`lessonId`
- These days would show no actual curriculum content to learners

### Days Fixed
- Weeks 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (Day 6 each)
- Weeks 15-24 (Day 6 each)

### Resolution
- Added appropriate `moduleId` and `lessonId` references to all lesson blocks
- Mapped lessons to relevant curriculum modules (grammar, vocab, situations, listening, etc.)

### Files Modified
- src/data/schedule.js

### Verification
- Total lessons: 94
- Lessons without moduleId: 0 (all fixed)
